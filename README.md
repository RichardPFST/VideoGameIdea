My submission for the Preliminary Video Game Idea
# Dungeon Delver
## Brief Synopsis of the game
I've never coded before this class so I'm unsure how obtainable all of these goals will be when considering the time restrictions but for my game I'm imagining something akin to the original Legend of Zelda or old Elder Scroll titles. I want a simple dungeon, preferably with some randomly generated rooms. Nothing to indepth or crazy, a 2D 8-bit game with some replayability
## Feature 1 Level System
The first feature I would like to incorporate would be a very simple level up system. All of your stats would increase per level to keep things simple but if I'm able to incorporate classes then the different classes would have different amount of increases to their stats but I don't know how ambitious that is.
## Feature 2 Classes
I'm thinking of three base classes, Rogue, Warrior, and Mage. Warrior and Mage are pretty straighforward but I'm unsure how to really incorporate Rogue in this idea besides the possibility of a passive dodge feature where with lighter armor you have a higher chance to dodge but I worry this wouldn't mix too well with mage since they would have little armor. It'd make mage the strongest since they would have high dodge, and powerful spells from range so I need to consider it more thoughtfully.
## Feature 3 Randomly Generated Dungeons.
This is the feature I fear is least obtainable because I'm thinking of a very base level 5 rooms but with some differences in enemy types and layout just some basic things to keep replayability up so it's not the same thing everytime.
## Feature 4 Loot
I would like to add in loot, preferably 3 or 4 tiers. there'd would be your starting gear at tier 1 and as you go further you can get better armor and weapons just basic loot system. It also ties in with the classes system becasue I'd think that with heavier armor, the less chance to dodge. So for Rogue, you could choose to keep your weaker armor for the higher chance to negate damage or grab stronger gear which'll still have a good chance to dodge but it also protects you more. I would prefer class specific loot to drop because I imagine it would save on resources not having to load in mage staffs on warrior.
